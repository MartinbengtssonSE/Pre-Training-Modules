# Basic functions
# Basic sum function works by just typing in what + what without other commands
# Since this chapter was very straight forward it only contains notes

# You can store a variable in this way by typing x <- 11 for an example where x
# can identify anything from an X to a part of a data table

# decimal values like 4.5 are called numerics
# natural numbers like 4 are called integers
# Boolean values (TRUE or FALSE) are called logical
# text (or string) values are called characters
