# Exercise 4 Discretize a Variables

# Calculate average reading score and show the value

library(dplyr)
library(openintro)
data(hsb2)

# Calculate average reading score and show the value
mean(hsb2$read)

# Calculate average reading score and store as avg_read. If you wrap it in () it will also print value as well as store it
avg_read <- mean(hsb2$read)

# Create new variable: read_cat
# Ifelse works with 1. the logical test 2 if true 3 if false
hsb2 <- hsb2 %>%
    mutate(read_cat = ifelse(read < avg_read,
        "below average", "at or above average"))
