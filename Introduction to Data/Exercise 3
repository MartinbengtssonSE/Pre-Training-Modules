# Exercise 3

# R often stores categorical data as factors
# Important to statistical modeling

# Number of students in public and private schools in hsb2
# Syntax refresher: name of datatable $ name of column

# Initial Load
# library(dplyr)
# library(openintro)
# data(hsb2)



# Number of students in public and private schools in hsb2
# table(hsb2$schtyp)

# Filter for public schools
# hsb2_public <- hsb2 %>%
# filter(schtyp == "public")

# The Pipe operator is known as %>%
# Is equal to is explained by ==

# Drop unused levels (this is for an example a bucket you no longer use)
# hsb2_public$schtyp <- droplevels(hsb2_public$schtyp)

# glimpse(hsb2_public)

# Example:

email50_big <- email50 %>%
    filter(number == "big")
table(email50_big$number)

email50_big$number_dropped <- droplevels(email50_big$number)
table(email50_big$number_dropped)
