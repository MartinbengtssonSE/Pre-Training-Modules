For setting up a new Project:

1: add folder
2: add project folder in Atom
3: Right-click the folder and select "git bash here"
4: You can now add files either thru git bash by "touch" command, in Atom or directly in the folder

"$ git init" to initilalize

set global user name and email:
git config --global user.name 'Name here'
git config --global user.email 'Email here'

Important commands in git bash:
"git status" to check what is in the staging area
"git rm --cached 'file name'"" to remove a file from the staging area
"git add ." to add all files to the staging area
"git commit" to commit changes for the files to the project file

You can also create a file called .gitignore and add exceptions in this file by typing
in file names in this new file. These files listed in .gitignore will always be ignored when committing

How to connect to Github Repository:
1: Create new repository in github
1A:   Make sure you do not create it with readme. It'll give you error message when you upload since
      what you will upload does not match what already exists
2: git remote add origin PATHHERE
3: git push -u origin master

Now when you update this file in the future you only need to save in Atom and go through the steps of saving and committing.
Once that is done you can just do the git push -m 'change name' and it will be pushed to the repository.
