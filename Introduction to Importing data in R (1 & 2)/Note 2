# Relational databases importing

# Database Management systems DBMS such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite are common
# Oracle Database, Microsoft SQL Server are some proprietary names
# SQL = Structured Query Language
# Different packages depending on database in R

# Connect to a SQL database

con <- dbConnect(RMySQL : :MySQL(), # Construct SQL driver
                dbname = "company"
                host = "courses.csrrinzqubik.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com",
                port = 3306,
                user = "student",
                password = "datacamp")

# the first argument specifies the driver that you will use to connect to the Server
# then you need to specify the information about the server
# con is a DBIConnection object
# by establishing the connection you can then type its name to see the server connection

# Once connected you can find out what is in the database by utilizing the following string
# it will show what tables are in the database

dbListTables(name given)

# You can then read one of the tables by using the following command

dbReadTable("given database name", "name of table")
dbDisconnect("given database name")

# Make a vector of the table names by:

tables <- dbListTables(given name to database, "table")
str(tables)

# To import all tables you can use the lapply function! For an example:

table_names <- dbListTables(con)
tables <- lapply(table_names, dbReadTable, conn = Server Connection)
